## Subservice

Subservice in ArozOS  are executables that require compilation on install. Subservices are mostly installed by the OEM manufacturer or Makers with technical backgrounds. Subservice installation can only be done via the host system shell (or ssh / terminal, depends on what you prefer to call it) and reboot of the system is required to make the installation effective.

ArozOS Subservice can access the system OS directly as it is executed as a "process" in the OS level. Subservice can also access ArozOS core functions using AGI interface with request tokens. In most case, subservice contains platform dependent codes and sometime also architecture dependent codes (e.g. ARM vs amd64). 

You can find all your installed Subservices under ./subservice folder inside your ArozOS root folder.
